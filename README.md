## 📖 Overview

This project is a creative take on a personal portfolio website, designed to mimic the **Kali Linux** operating system. It provides an immersive "hacker" experience that starts from the boot sequence, goes through a realistic login screen, and lands on a functional desktop environment where users can explore "apps" to learn about my skills, projects, and background.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🖥️ Realistic Boot Sequence**: Simulates real Linux kernel boot logs, system checks, and service startups with a CRT monitor effect.
- **🔐 Interactive Login Screen**: Features a sleek login UI with password entry animations and profile selection.
- **🖼️ Dynamic Desktop Environment**: 
  - Randomly rotates between high-quality wallpapers on each visit.
  - Wallpaper fits perfectly above the taskbar without visual overflow.
  - Draggable windows and desktop icons.
- **🔎 Functional Apps**:
  - **Terminal**: A working terminal emulator to run commands and navigate the "file system".
  - **VS Code**: A simulated code editor to showcase snippets or configs.
  - **Chrome**: A browser-in-browser experience.
  - **Portfolio Apps**: "About Me", "Skills", and "Projects" presented as native OS windows.
- **⚡ Smooth Animations**: Powered by `framer-motion` for fluid window opening, closing, and maximizing transitions.
- **🎨 Custom Theming**: Tailored Tailwind CSS configuration for that authentic "Kali Dark" aesthetic, including custom tooltips and taskbar trays.
